Step 1: Check for SSH keys

First, we need to check for existing SSH keys on your computer. Open the command line and enter:

ls -al ~/.ssh
# Lists the files in your .ssh directory, if they exist

Check the directory listing to see if you already have a public SSH key. By default, the filenames of the public keys are one of the following:

    id_dsa.pub
    id_ecdsa.pub
    id_ed25519.pub
    id_rsa.pub
